# Food-Delivery-Time-Estimation
Machine Learning project that predicts food delivery time in minutes using historical order data, location features, and real-time contextual information.

Food delivery companies need to provide accurate delivery time in minutes for each customer order. However, actual delivery time varies because of many unpredictable factors such as:

#   Distance between restaurant and customer

#   Traffic conditions

#   Time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)

#   Weather

#   Driver's Experience and Vehicle Type

#   Restaurant preparation time

Because of these variations, current delivery time estimates can be inaccurate. This results in:

#   Customer dissatisfaction

#   Increased complaints and cancellations

#   Inefficient restaurant coordination

The problem is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the food delivery time in minutes for each order based on historical data and real-time features.

The model should learn patterns from past deliveries and produce a reliable delivery time estimate for new orders.
